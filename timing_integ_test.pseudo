subprocess can create a Popen object
Text may be piped into this object
Want timing to create this object then `boot conf start`
Then run_nanorc fixture is used, results are collected
Then stop is sent to the Popen object
Results of timing are collected and also returned

Default method looks in the file the test is run from to create the configuration
We would need to write the configuration into this file as a dictionary. Alternatively we makea  function to parse the json file and create the configuration dictionary form that (I prefer this)

Use import json
Then dict = json.load
