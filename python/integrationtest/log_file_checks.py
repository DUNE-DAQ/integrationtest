# 23-Nov-2021, KAB: added the ability for users to specify sets of excluded substrings, to
# enable checking of all log files, and to print out the logfile name when there are problems.
#
# This function accepts the following arguments:
# * the list of logfiles to be checked (array of PythonPath objects)
# * a flag to control whether all logfiles are checked for problems or whether checking
#   stops as soon as one file with problems is found (default is to check them all)
# * a flag to control whether the logfile name is printed to the console when an a problem
#   is first found in that logfile (default is printout)
# * the sets of excluded substrings.  This goal of this argument is to allow certain
#   select messages to be ignored so that overall checking of logfiles can remain enabled
#   without being distracted by 'expected' problems.  This argument is expected to be a
#   dictionary keyed by strings that might appear in the logfile name and having values
#   that are lists of excluded phrases.  Both the logfile name key and the excluded phrases
#   support regular expressions.  Use r"<regex_pattern>" to handle any special patterns.
#   For example:
#   ex_sub_map = {"ruemu": ["expected problem phrase 1", "expected problem  phrase 2"]}
#   ex_sub_map = {"ruemu": [r"expected problem phrase \d+"]}
